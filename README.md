# Book Madness app

As an beginner Android developer, I embarked on a personal project to create a Book Management App, demonstrating my skills and passion for Android development. 
The idea for this app came from my personal experience of maintaining a list of books I read, along with ratings, in a physical notebook. Recognizing the need for a more convenient and accessible solution, I decided to provide an app for managing reading material seamlessly.
